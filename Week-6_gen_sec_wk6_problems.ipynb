    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will explore the problem of estimating probabilities from data using Bayesian faremework. The goal is to start with prior information on some paramater of interest (Ex. $\\theta$) and update it according to some observed data. Based on the Bayes' theorom, **_posterior_** distribution incorporates observations $x$ into the distribution of the parameter of interest. In this setup posterior distribution serves as a summary of data and can be expressed as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\theta | x) = \\frac{p(x|\\theta)p(\\theta)}{\\int_{\\theta}p(x|\\theta)p(\\theta)d\\theta}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $p(x|\\theta)$ is the likelihood (model) distribution that summarizes the information about experimental data and $p(\\theta)$ is the prior distribution that quantifies available knowledge about the parameter of interest, and also describes the uncertainty about this parameter before data are observed. In other words prior distribution describes our best guess about parameters before obeserving the data."

Based on a preliminary results using sample aize of 10 it is belived that on average 90% of patients will respond to this medication. Also investigators belive that it will be unlikely that this proportion will go bellow 80%. Define and plot a prior distribution based on this preliminary result. **Hint:** You can consider using the Beta function."
